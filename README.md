# Liquid Dispenser Portfolio Project
![project image banner](https://github.com/LaRoomy/Liquid_Dispenser/blob/main/Resource/pipes_banner_img.png)


 The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my C/C++ embedded programming skills. Many programming techniques and microcontroller functions are covered by this project:
 - Basic C/C++ development
 - C/C++ Design Patterns
 - C driver development
 - Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)
 - Dependency Injection
 - Unit Testing of embedded code
 - Real Time Operating System (RTOS)
 - Near Field Communication (NFC)
 - Controller Area Network (CAN)
 - Other common busses (I2C, UART, SPI)

> [!NOTE]
> All code is developed and written by myself using the reference documents of the respective devices and peripherals, except the driver for the ILI9341 display. This files are adapted and rewritten, to conform with the object based c programming, using the [stm32-ili9341](https://github.com/afiskon/stm32-ili9341/tree/master) library.
